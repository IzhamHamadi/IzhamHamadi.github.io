    </div>
    <p>Toyyibpay is an online payment gateway with aim to help small and medium businesses to run their operations with low cost as Toyyibpay offers low charge fees or no change fees at all for every transaction. Toyyibpay has been launched in mid of 2018 as Version 1 by using open source framework which is CodeIgniter framework. Toyyibpay also provides APIs and plugins to be used for developers and businesses to integrate their systems or websites with Toyyibpay. After a year running this online gateway as the customerâ€™s registrations and transactions increases, the development team realizes that they need to develop a new version with advanced features to fit customer requirements as requested and to offer more features that might help businesses to run their operations.</p>
